<h2> Art and Music</h2>
Here's an <a href = "rothkoessay.doc">essay </a> on Mark Rothko and the Rothko Chapel compositions by Morton Feldman and Steve Reich. I was fortunate enough, recently to ask Steve Reich a question after a lecture he gave at the Guildhall School of Music. I asked him if he was influenced by the work of Feldman and Rothko when he was commissioned to write Tehillim. He said that the commission was actually funded by a few organisations and was not directly linked with Rothko or Feldman. So there is the answer to the ponderings in my essay...

<h2> Origami</h2>
here's a link to a film that i helped contribute some origami for. Sadly, my origami models were not needed in the end but the <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A4610620"> film </a> is great!
<p>
And here's a link to the <a href = "http://www.britishorigami.org.uk/" > British Origami Society</a>
<p>
<a href = "http://langorigami.com">Robert Lang </a>, origami consultant and previous laser physicist. Designed lense folding method for space shuttle...
<p>This isn't origami...  but it's great! By an artist called <a href="http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/2005/demand.html">Thomas Demand</a>.
